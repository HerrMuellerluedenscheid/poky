# strace https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2000-0006
# CVE is more than 20 years old with no resolution evident

# epiphany https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2005-0238
# The issue here is spoofing of domain names using characters from other character sets.
# There has been much discussion amongst the epiphany and webkit developers and
# whilst there are improvements about how domains are handled and displayed to the user
# there is unlikely ever to be a single fix to webkit or epiphany which addresses this
# problem. Whitelisted as there isn't any mitigation or fix or way to progress this further
# we can seem to take.

# glibc https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2010-4756
# Issue is memory exhaustion via glob() calls, e.g. from within an ftp server
# Best discussion in https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=681681
# Upstream don't see it as a security issue, ftp servers shouldn't be passing
# this to libc glob. Exclude as upstream have no plans to add BSD's GLOB_LIMIT or similar
